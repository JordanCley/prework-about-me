      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a 33 year old male from Kokomo, Indiana. I moved out to 
        Los Angeles 6 years ago to work in the entertainment industry as a 
        dancer/skater. I always knew I wanted to find a new career path since 
        dancing isn't a life long situation. I just never imagined I would be 
        inspired to jump into web development. Since the first few days of 
        learning to code I have been hooked and I can't wait to be actively 
        working in this field!    
      </p>  
    
      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>
        I love to stay active! I enjoy dancning, skating, bowling, golfing,
        snowboarding and skateboarding.
      </p>  

      <h1>Dream Job</h1>
      <p>
        My dream job at this point is to work anywhere in the industry at this 
        point! I just want it to be a place that I can constantly learn and 
        grow. I think after I get my gears in the field a little more, I will
        have a better idea of my dream position!
